### Create a DockerCompose file

Pull the images

```bash
docker-compose pull
```

Stop the stack

```bash
docker-compose down
```

Restart the stack

```bash
docker-compose restart
```

Delete a service

```bash
docker-compose rm -f <serice>
```

Connect to the database:

```bash
mysql -u root -h localhost -p
```

Give Access to a remote login:

```sql
GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'root'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Execute a command inside a docker container:

```bash
docker exec -i
```

```bash
docker exec -i mariadb_db_1 sh
```

Create the database.

 docker-compose  --env-file ./.config/.env.mariadb  run --rm gotrue gotrue migrate
